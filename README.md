# Udacity Personal Portfolio Mock-up
A mock-up portfolio page to recreate as practice for building my own responsive portfolio site.  Working on this project should showcase my current abilities using front-end tools to develop and style a web page.

## Project Overview

The completed portfolio page mock-up will be evaluated using a project specification (rubric), which can be found [here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/45/view).

This mock-up utilizes a pre-conceived page design which I will follow for the page's initial structure and styling.  This design can be downloaded [here](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/November/5a136147_design-mockup-portfolio/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf)

## Developer Notes

- The header container with the Udacity logo is left-aligned.  The name of the portfolio owner and their subtitle are right-aligned.

- The header is separated from main content area (a section) by a thick grey horizontal rule (#7dd97ad).

- On either side of this horizontal rule, there is an even amount of margin (take actual measures of pixel spacing throughout).

- A large image is utilized in the body of the portfolio.  My aim is to follow the rubric and make this image responsive as it is the main content (think placeholder) for the **_mock-up_** portfolio.

- The next section is a collection of featured work utilizing images.  Consider how this section would be made responsive - e.g., the content should be stacked for narrower viewport widths.
